The jupyter notebook won't load here in github, so, I posted a .pdf.  I tried deeleting it a reloading it a few times and can't resolve the issue.  Works fine on linx and pc.

Also, had some difficulty getting this to work and nver fully worked in Linux.  The splinter command "browser.visit" worked in a jupyter notebook but not when run in the python script. Would like to resolve but was not able to for this submittal.
